            Hi there! I'm Bryan, a Web Developer based in Southern California,
            and I love creating web applications that people can enjoy and use.
            My goal is to create products that clients are proud of, and to
            architect clean and readable code. Here are a few technologies I
            have been working with lately

          </div>
        </div>
